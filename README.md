# Data Analytics
Given a data set the attached CSV file, I am going to demonstrate my understanding of the data and some possible meanings.

### Tools
I am learning data science for the first time and so I am using online resources to learn about the concepts.

### Installation / Registrations
As I looked at the data set I thought there must be a tool to begin to make sense of this. I opened the data set in Microsoft excel and looked at the column headings.

1. user_id
2. activity_date
3. steps

Given I recently saw the movie Hidden Figures and how machines can do so much data processing now I figured IBM must have a tool for this.

**IBM Watson Analytics**

As a student there is a free version, you must enter your student email address and then they set you up with an educational account, there are even data sets on the platform for students to play around with. You can upload files like data sets in a CSV version to start. Thats what I did.

Watson came up with a few paths for me to track down and a few questions that I could ask about my data set.

I also starting watching the introductory videos for the Edx course on big data in education and the first video gave examples of how to use a specific technology that was new for me.

**RapidMiner**
I immediately looked up this technology and found another student had the same question as me:

Q: What RapidMiner can do that Excel can't?

A: Data mining? All kind of cool statistic stuff? Just to name a few.. Unless you put al kind of complex statistical equations into a bunch of macro's, it is quite impossible to do proper data mining in Excel.

With RapidMiner for education you can get free student access if you set up your account as one for educational purposes and test it out. So far I have downloaded the software and am starting to play with it.
